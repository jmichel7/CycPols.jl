# CycPols
Products of Cyclotomic polynomials.

Cyclotomic  numbers, and cyclotomic polynomials  over the rationals or some
cyclotomic  field, are important in the theories of finite reductive groups
and  Spetses. In particular Schur elements of cyclotomic Hecke algebras are
products of cyclotomic polynomials.
